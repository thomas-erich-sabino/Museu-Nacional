## About
This site is about a brazilian museum that unfortunatelly caught fire on September 02, 2018, for reasons as yet unknown.<br>
Site composed by a header at the top of the page, with a logo, and an interesting navigation bar. The main section of the page is where resides a multi-column layout. A detail in this project is the usage of new HTML tags such as `<header></header>`, `<nav></nav>`, `<section></section>`, `<article></article>`, `<footer></footer>`, `<aside></aside>`, and HTML 5 shiv. 

### HTML 5 shiv
HTML 5 shiv or shim, both are correct, enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.<br>
You can choose to get th .js file or just a link, just like the example.<br>
